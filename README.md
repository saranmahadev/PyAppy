# PyAppy

---

## Mission

**PyAppy** is a transformative Python-first framework that empowers developers to build high-performance, visually consistent applications for **web, mobile (Android, iOS), and desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux)** using a single Python codebase. 

By providing an intuitive, Pythonic UI system, a custom transpiler, and a modular architecture, PyAppy aims to simplify cross-platform development, making **Python the universal language** for creating modern, scalable applications.

---

## Vision

To revolutionize application development by unifying web, mobile, and desktop platforms under a single Python codebase‚Äîenabling developers to create professional-grade apps with minimal complexity. 

PyAppy seeks to foster innovation by offering a **seamless development experience**, **robust performance**, and **extensive extensibility**, appealing to developers of all skill levels.

---

## Goals

- **Unified Codebase**: One Python codebase that delivers applications across platforms with consistent behavior and native-like UX.
- **Pythonic Development**: Declarative UI system using Python‚Äôs syntax and ecosystem.
- **High Performance**: Near-native execution through optimized code generation and rendering.
- **Extensibility**: Plugin system for platform-specific APIs while keeping development Python-centric.
- **Developer Experience**: Hot reload, powerful CLI, intuitive debugging.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for prototypes to full-scale enterprise apps.
- **Community Building**: Ecosystem with documentation, package manager, tutorials, and developer engagement.

## Core Features

### ‚úÖ Declarative UI System

Build UIs with a **widget-based, tree-like** architecture that‚Äôs reusable and reactive.

```python
from PyAppy.widgets import Widget, Column, Text, Button

class WelcomeApp(Widget):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.message = "Hello, PyAppy!"

    def update_message(self):
        self.message = "Welcome to PyAppy!"

    def build(self):
        return Column(
            children=[
                Text(self.message, font_size=24),
                Button(text="Update", on_click=self.update_message)
            ]
        )
```

- **Benefits**: Reactive updates, reusable components, readable syntax.

---

### üåê Cross-Platform Support

Run the **same Python codebase** on:

- **Web**: Rendered via JavaScript or WebAssembly
- **Mobile**: Native apps for Android and iOS
- **Desktop**: Standalone apps for Windows, macOS, Linux

Consistent behavior and appearance across all platforms.

---

### üîÅ Custom Transpiler

Converts Python into **optimized platform-specific code**:

- **Web**: JavaScript or WebAssembly (WASM)
- **Mobile/Desktop**: Compiled native or embedded Python runtimes

Ensures performance, small footprint, and platform compliance.

---

### ‚ö° High-Performance Rendering

Utilizes platform-specific renderers:

- **Web**: WebGL
- **Mobile**: Android Canvas, iOS UIKit
- **Desktop**: Skia, Direct2D, Metal

Supports animations, responsive layouts, and high FPS rendering.

---

### üîå Plugin System

Access platform-specific features with clean Python APIs:

```python
from PyAppy.plugins import CameraPlugin
```

- Internally bridges to native SDKs
- Keeps the Python layer clean and consistent

---

### üîÑ Reactive State Management

Auto-tracking of state updates and **fine-grained UI updates**:

- Uses Python properties or observable models
- Example: Modifying `self.message` in a widget triggers a re-render of affected UI nodes

---

### üìê Layout System

Flexible layout tools:

- **Widgets**: `Column`, `Row`, `Stack`, etc.
- **Responsive Design**: Handles different screen sizes and orientations
- Example: `Column(alignment="center", spacing=10)`

---

### üñ±Ô∏è Event Handling

Maps gestures and UI events to Python functions:

- **Supported Gestures**: Tap, click, swipe, pinch, drag
- Example: `Button(on_click=self.update_message)`

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Developer Tools

- **Hot Reload**: Fast, sub-second UI updates during development
- **CLI**:
  - `pyappy run`
  - `pyappy build`
  - `pyappy debug`
- **Debugger**: Source mapping, breakpoints, real-time state inspection
- **Package Manager**:
  - `pyappy install ui-kit`
  - Manages PyAppy-specific widgets/plugins

---

### üß© Ecosystem Integration

- Leverages existing libraries: `numpy`, `requests`, `pandas`
- Adapts common Python packages for cross-platform via transpilation
- Dedicated **PyAppy package registry** for community extensions

---
